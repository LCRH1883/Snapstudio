    <h1>Privacy Policy for Snap Swipe</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 25, 2025</p>
    <p class="muted">This privacy policy describes how Snap Swipe ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, shares, and safeguards personal information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We publish this policy to comply with Google Play User Data policies, which require a publicly accessible privacy policy that explains what data is collected and how it is handled.</p>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>About Snap Swipe</strong>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe is an Android photo clean-up app. It shows one photo at a time so you can swipe to keep, delete, or share. The App runs on-device, does not display ads, and does not upload your photos to any server.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>1. Data We Collect</strong>
      <p class="muted"><em>Summary: Snap Swipe is designed to minimize data collection. No account is required, and photos stay on your device.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos and user content.</strong> When you review photos, Snap Swipe accesses them via Android MediaStore to display and process your keep/delete/share actions. We do not upload or store copies of your photos.</li>
        <li><strong>Support and feedback.</strong> If you contact us, we collect your email address and the details you provide so we can respond.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and diagnostic data.</strong> We may collect anonymized crash logs and basic diagnostics (device model, OS version, language, time zone) to troubleshoot issues. We do not collect advertising IDs, SIM serials, build serials, MAC addresses, IMEI, IMSI, or other unique hardware identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage statistics.</strong> We may collect aggregated, anonymized feature-usage counts (for example, number of photos processed). This data does not include personal identifiers and is not used for ads.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>1.3 Permissions</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos/Media access.</strong> Required to display and manage images. Snap Swipe requests Android runtime permission (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES on Android 13+, READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE on older versions).</li>
        <li><strong>No sensitive permissions.</strong> We do not request location, microphone, contacts, phone state, or other sensitive permissions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>2. How We Use Information</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain the App (show photos, handle keep/delete/share actions).</li>
        <li>Improve the App (aggregate diagnostics and usage to fix crashes and refine features).</li>
        <li>Communicate with you when you reach out for support.</li>
        <li>Comply with applicable law or valid legal requests.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe does not sell personal or sensitive user data and does not share data with advertising networks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>3. How We Share Information</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers.</strong> We may use third-party services (e.g., website hosting, email) that act on our behalf under data-protection obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance.</strong> We may disclose information to comply with law, court orders, or to protect rights and safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers.</strong> In a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, data may transfer as permitted by law. We will provide notice before a different policy applies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">We do not share data with advertising partners and do not connect data to advertising identifiers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>4. Data Retention and Deletion</strong>
      <p class="muted">Photos are processed locally and not retained by us. Aggregated diagnostics are kept only as long as needed to improve the App, then deleted or anonymized. If you contact us, you may request deletion of your correspondence unless we must retain it for legal or security reasons.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>5. Data Security</strong>
      <p class="muted">We use appropriate technical and organizational measures (for example, secure connections and limited access) to protect data. No method is perfectly secure; protect your device with a strong passcode.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>6. International Data Transfers</strong>
      <p class="muted">Our website or support services may operate in other countries. We apply appropriate safeguards where required by law.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>7. Your Rights</strong>
      <p class="muted">Depending on your region, you may request access, correction, deletion, objection, or restriction of processing, and withdrawal of consent where applicable. Because we do not store your photos, these rights mainly apply to support correspondence or diagnostics. Contact us to exercise these rights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>8. Children’s Privacy</strong>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe is built to be family-friendly: no ads, no in-app purchases, no social features, and no collection of personal data from children. We do not request advertising identifiers or sensitive permissions. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us so we can remove it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>9. Third-Party Links</strong>
      <p class="muted">Links to third-party sites are outside our control; review their privacy policies when you visit them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>10. Contact Information</strong>
      <p class="muted">For privacy questions or to exercise your rights, contact us:</p>

      <strong>11. Changes to This Policy</strong>
      <p class="muted">We may update this policy from time to time. The effective date will change when updates are posted. Continued use of Snap Swipe after updates means you accept the revised policy.</p>
