    <h1>Privacy Policy for Snap Swipe</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 25 2025</p>
    <p class="muted">This privacy policy describes how Snap Swipe (“we,” “our” or “us”) collects, uses, shares and safeguards personal information when you use our mobile application (the “App”). We publish this policy to comply with Google Play’s User Data policies, which require apps to provide a publicly accessible privacy policy describing the types of data they collect and how that data is handled, including any data retention and deletion practices <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>. Even if an app does not access personal or sensitive user data, Google Play still requires a privacy policy <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</p>

      <strong>About Snap Swipe</strong>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe is a photo clean‑up and editing app. It enables you to remove unwanted objects from your photos by swiping across them. The App runs entirely on your device and does not display advertisements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>1. Data We Collect</strong>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe is designed to operate with minimal data collection. We do not require you to create an account or provide personal identifiers to use the core features of the App. We only collect information necessary to provide and improve the App’s functionality.</p>
      <h4>1.1 Information you provide</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos and user content.</strong> When you load a photo into Snap Swipe for editing, the image is processed locally on your device. We do not upload your photos to our servers for processing, and we do not collect or store copies of your photos. All edits occur offline and remain on your device unless you choose to share the edited image.</li>
        <li><strong>Support and feedback.</strong> If you contact us via email or through a feedback form, we collect your email address and any information you provide in your message. We use this information solely to respond to your inquiry and improve the App.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>1.2 Automatically collected information</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device and diagnostic data.</strong> To ensure the App functions correctly, we may collect anonymized diagnostic information such as error logs, device model, operating‑system version, language and time‑zone settings. This information helps us troubleshoot issues and improve performance. It does not include unique device identifiers such as Android Advertising ID (AAID), SIM serial, build serial, MAC address, IMEI or IMSI <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>, and it does not identify you personally.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage statistics.</strong> We may collect aggregated, anonymized statistics about how features are used (for example, number of images edited or common filters applied). These statistics do not include personal data. Snap Swipe does not use advertising identifiers, does not collect App Set ID and does not request AD_ID permission for ads personalization <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>1.3 Permissions</h4>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe may request access to your device’s photo library or storage to allow you to select images for editing. The App uses Android’s runtime permission system and provides an in‑App disclosure explaining what data will be accessed and why <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>. We only request permissions necessary for core functionality and do not access data outside those purposes <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>. We do not request or use sensitive permissions such as precise or approximate location, microphone, camera access beyond photo selection, contacts or phone state <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>. Your denial of a permission may limit certain features, but the App will continue to function where possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>2. How We Use Information</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain the App. Access to your photos is required to perform the clean‑up and editing functions. Diagnostic information helps us ensure the App operates correctly.</li>
        <li>Improve the App. Aggregated usage statistics and crash logs enable us to understand which features are popular and identify areas for improvement. We do not use this data for advertising or marketing.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you. If you contact us, we may use your email address to respond to your inquiries. We do not send marketing emails.</li>
        <li>Comply with law. We may process information as necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal requests.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe does not sell personal or sensitive user data <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a> and does not share any information with advertising networks or data brokers. The App contains no advertisements, and we do not use collected data for targeted marketing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>3. How We Share Information</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers.</strong> We may use third‑party service providers to host our website, handle support emails or collect aggregated analytics. These providers act on our behalf and are contractually obligated to use data only for the purposes specified by us and to protect it from unauthorized access <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance.</strong> We may disclose information if required to comply with a legal obligation, court order or regulatory authority. We may also share information to protect our rights or the safety of users.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers.</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition or asset sale, user data may be transferred as permitted by law. We will provide notice before personal data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">We do not share user data with advertising partners or analytics companies for ads personalization and we do not connect any data to App Set ID or other advertising identifiers <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>4. Data Retention and Deletion</strong>
      <p class="muted">Because we process your photos locally on your device and do not store copies, there is no remote retention of your images. Anonymized diagnostic and usage data are retained only as long as necessary to analyze performance and improve the App. When we no longer need this data, we delete it or anonymize it.</p>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe does not require account registration, so there is no App account to delete. If you contact us for support, you may request that we delete your email and any associated personal information from our support records. We will honor valid deletion requests unless we must retain certain data for legal or security reasons <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>5. Data Security</strong>
      <p class="muted">We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure. This includes transmitting data over secure connections (HTTPS/TLS) <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>, limiting access to authorized personnel and regularly reviewing our security practices. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. You should take steps to protect your device and data, such as using a strong passcode.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>6. International Data Transfers</strong>
      <p class="muted">Our servers and service providers may be located in countries other than your own. By using Snap Swipe, you understand that your information may be transferred to and processed in different jurisdictions. We comply with applicable data‑protection laws and implement appropriate safeguards for cross‑border data transfers <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>7. Your Rights</strong>
      <p class="muted">Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights under privacy laws such as the EU GDPR, the UK Data Protection Act or Canada’s PIPEDA. These rights may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and correction.</strong> You may request access to personal information we hold about you (if any) and ask us to correct inaccuracies.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion.</strong> You may request deletion of personal information. Because we do not store your photos, deletion typically applies to support correspondence or diagnostic logs. We will delete data unless we must retain it for legitimate reasons <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Objection and restriction.</strong> You may object to or ask us to restrict processing where permitted by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent withdrawal.</strong> Where we rely on consent, you may withdraw it at any time. This will not affect processing that has already occurred.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details below. We may need to verify your identity before responding.</p>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>8. Children’s Privacy</strong>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe is designed to be enjoyed by users of all ages, including children. When selecting the target age group in the Google Play Console, we have marked the App as appropriate for all ages. To meet Google Play’s Families Policy requirements, we have built the App so that it is safe for children and families <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>. Key points include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Content appropriateness:</strong> The App’s sole purpose is to let you remove unwanted objects from your own photos. It does not contain any adult content, violence, or other material inappropriate for children <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>No data collection from children:</strong> We do not collect personal or sensitive information from children. There is no account creation, and photos are processed locally on your device. We do not transmit or store your images on our servers <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>No advertising or monetization:</strong> Snap Swipe displays no ads, does not offer in‑app purchases, and does not contain cross‑promotions. This means children will not see any advertising content <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>No transmission of unique identifiers:</strong> We do not transmit Android Advertising ID (AAID), SIM serial, build serial, MAC address, IMEI, IMSI or other unique device identifiers from any user, including children <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>. Snap Swipe does not request the AD_ID permission on Android API 33 or higher <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>No location or sensitive permissions:</strong> The App does not request precise or approximate location permissions, microphone access, or any sensor data other than access to your photos. We use the minimum permissions necessary to allow you to select and edit images <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>No unapproved APIs or SDKs:</strong> We do not integrate APIs or SDKs that are not approved for child‑directed services. The App’s editing functionality runs locally and does not rely on third‑party services <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>No social or AR features:</strong> Snap Swipe has no social sharing features within the App. It does not allow users to chat, share content or interact with strangers, nor does it contain augmented‑reality features that would require additional safety warnings <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance with laws:</strong> We comply with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable privacy laws <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>. Because we do not collect personal data from children, there is no need for parental consent. Should we introduce features that require data collection or social interaction in the future, we will implement a neutral age screen and obtain verifiable parental consent where required <a href="http://support.google.com">support.google.com</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">If you believe a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this policy, please contact us immediately using the details below so that we can remove the information.</p>
