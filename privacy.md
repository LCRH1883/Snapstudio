    <h1>Snap Swipe Privacy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Snap Swipe is designed to work entirely on your device. It requests only the Android photo permissions needed to let you review, delete, and share images you select.</p>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>What Snap Swipe accesses</strong>
      <p class="muted">Device photos via Android’s MediaStore. The app requests READ_MEDIA_IMAGES (or READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE on older Android versions) to display your images.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>Data collection</strong>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe does not collect, store, or transmit your photos or personal data to any server. There are no accounts, analytics SDKs, or ads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>On-device operations</strong>
      <p class="muted">All keep/delete/share decisions happen locally. When you delete a photo, Snap Swipe uses the Android-recommended MediaStore delete APIs, which may show a system confirmation dialog. The app does not keep a separate copy of your photos.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>Sharing photos</strong>
      <p class="muted">When you choose to share, the app launches the Android share sheet with the selected photo URI and grants temporary read access. No other photos are shared.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>Permissions</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Photos/Media access: required to display and manage your images.</li>
        <li>No location, contacts, microphone, or other sensitive permissions are requested.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>Data retention</strong>
      <p class="muted">Snap Swipe does not retain additional copies of your photos. Processed items are removed from the in-app session list, but remain in your gallery unless you delete them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>Changes</strong>
      <p class="muted">If this privacy approach changes, the in-app About/Settings copy and this page will be updated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="privacy-block">
      <strong>Questions</strong>
      <p class="muted">For privacy questions, open an issue in the Snapstudio repository on GitHub.</p>
